# workAssignments
I am a React Intern and this is a/an Task/assignment for learning at work at a company called VisionX.
The task was divided into three sections:
1: Learning(2 days:Monday-Tuesday)
2: Task(2 days:Wednesday-Thursday)
3: Code Review(1 day: Friday)

I started learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I chose free code camp (freecodecamp.org) or FCC to learn HTML and CSS.
I reported to my line manager(F) when I had finished all the HTML and CSS relevant courses on FCC.

I was given two days to complete the afore mentioned task by making a page by referencing two mock ups which were provided to me by my line manager(F)along with
all the assets needed.I tried my best to make it perfect.

Day 1:
I had this feeling that I did not do justice to my FCC course and started my learning again, so no work done on day 1 because I spent it all on going through my course again.

Day 2: It was weekend and the last day of my work assignment. I started work this day around 12PM, created a new project and finished almost 80% of the desktop version and 40% of 
the reponsive work. We(me and my fellow react-intern) were given weekend to complete the assignment since both of us had not finished on time.

Weekend:
      Saturday: Got-up late. Friends came over, so no work done.
      Sunday: No sleep last night, still with friends, slept for three hours during commute in the day. Came back around 6 in the monday morning.
      
Monday: 
      Sleep deprieved I got to work again. Finished 90% of the desktop site and 75% of the responsive site. Got in a code review meeting with my LM on MS Teams.
      Got some nice feedback.
                            -Use html instead of htm
                            -Use descriptive class names
                            -Align/justify correctly 
                            -Avoid Numerals in class names
                            -Use what is necessary
       One more day was given to act upon the feedback.
Tuesday: 
       Got to office around 10:50Am. Finished my work Desktop 98% and responsive around 96%.
       Went back home and pushed my code on github. 
       Informed my LM about code push.
